# Pentris
Get ready to dominate the leaderboard in Pentris, the ultimate five-square Tetris challenge! Your mission: Clear as many lines as possible and rack up maximum points to ascend to the top of the leaderboard. But be warned, stacking Pentriminos haphazardly will lead to a game over. Strategize to maneuver and fit the shapes together flawlessly within the game area, filling each row to clear lines and score big. And with the help of the Ghost Piece, you can visualize the optimal placement for each falling Pentrimino to maximize your potential. Keep an eye on the Next Queue to plan ahead and set up epic scoring opportunities, or swap out a piece in the Hold Queue for a surprise advantage. Can you handle the challenge and become the ultimate Pentris champion?
